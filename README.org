#+TITLE: .emacs.d
#+DESCRIPTION: GNU Emacs, just the way I like it
#+AUTHOR: Aaron Kuehler

This repository holds my emacs configuration.

* Installation

1. Clone this repository
  #+begin_src sh
    git clone https://indiebrain@github.com/indiebrain/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d/
  #+end_src
2. Run emacs. The configuration is automatically compiled and loaded
   via =org-babel=

* Notes

This configuration is compatible with Emacs 27+ and uses =org-babel=
to maintain a Literate Style configuration in
[[./configuration.org][configuration.org]]. [[./init.el][During initialization, =org-babel-tangle= is used
to compile the =configuration.el= from the code content contained
within =configuration.org=]].

Since version 24, Emacs has inforporated the ELPA package manager as
core functionality. The configuration makes heavy use of the =package=
and =use-package=.
